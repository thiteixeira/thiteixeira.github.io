## Short bio
I received my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering with concentration in Networks from [Unisinos University](www.unisinos.br/) in Southern Brazil. During my degree, I studied one year abroad at the College of Information and Communication Engineering at the [Sungkyunkwan University](www.skku.edu/) in South Korea, where I had the opportunity to intern at Samsung Electronics and Hana Micron. I'm now a fifth year PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](www.umass.edu).

My research focus on [Information-Centric Networking (ICN)](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/irtf/wiki/icnrg), Wireless Communications, and Internet Economics.
