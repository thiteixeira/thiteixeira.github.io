## Short bio
I received my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering with concentration in Networks from [Unisinos University](www.unisinos.br/) in Southern Brazil. During my degree, I studied one year abroad at the College of Information and Communication Engineering at the [Sungkyunkwan University](www.skku.edu/) in South Korea, where I had the opportunity to intern at Samsung Electronics and Hana Micron. I'm now a fifth year PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](www.umass.edu).

My research focus on [Information-Centric Networking (ICN)](https://trac.ietf.org/trac/irtf/wiki/icnrg), Wireless Communications, and Internet Economics.

## Research Experience
#### Offloading Cellular Traffic from Next-Generation Cellular Base Stations
The soaring number of mobile devices, coupled with the increase in traffic, is posing a significant challenge to cellular networks. Network operators have to deploy more base stations to cope with the load and user's expectations; however, this approach increases complexity and it's hard to manage. We propose M2M communication that applies Information-Centric Networking (ICN) to fetch content from nearby peers prior to sending the request to the RAN. In this ongoing research, we expect to successfully fetch partial contents from the MANET, ultimately offloading base stations.

#### Information-Centric Networking in Disconnected, Intermittent, and Low-Bandwidth (DIL) Environments
Conventional TCP/IP struggles as Mobile Ad hoc networks in DIL environments experience occasional disconnections and energy constraints. This work investigates ICN caching and forwarding strategies in MANET instead of commonly used protocols, such as OLSR and AODV. We developed a cross-layer approach that improves latency in ICN-MANET.

#### Economics of a Future Internet with Choices
In future Internet architectures, customers will be able to choose network services with a finer granularity than the current lengthy and costly contracts. We envision that these interactions between the different actors will be done in marketplaces for network services. We developed an agent-based simulator to study the economic outcomes on a variety of scenarios, showing that monopolistic providers do not have incentive to innovate. In addition, innovative providers can thrive in a competitive market where race to the bottom is expected.
